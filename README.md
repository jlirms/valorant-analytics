## FAQs

- *How did you get involved with NRG?* I started by making heatmaps on the [Valorant Competitive Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValorantCompetitive/) and the coach of NRG [JoshRT](https://twitter.com/JoshRTz) followed me on Twitter. I sent him some ideas, and luckily for me he was willing to try it! Data only takes you so far, seeing it in action has been very rewarding. 

- *I saw your heatmaps on reddit, how is this different?* [The heatmaps](https://twitter.com/DeMarsDeRover) were meant to be a visualiation tool of *x* and *y* positions *only*. It does not account for the context of a fight such as guns and armor, that's where the model shines. 

- *Where is this data coming from?* The data is provided by the VALORANT Data API, and is sorted and parsed by [Runitback.gg](https://rib.gg/). None of this would have been possible without RunItBack's support. Join their [discord](https://discord.gg/aceNhaM), it's a great place to start with VALORANT analytics.
